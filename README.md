This is a basic implementation of a todo list in TypeScript. Depending on your requirements, you can expand this implementation by adding features such as task prioritization, due dates, categories, and persistence (e.g., storing tasks in a database or local storage). Additionally, you can create user interfaces to interact with the todo list, allowing users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed through a graphical interface.
